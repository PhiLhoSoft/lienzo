This is a list of things that didn't make it into this release (and may never make it in)
The order of this list is arbitrary.

* DragConstraintEnforcer
  - should be able to set it on a node (rather than override getDragConstraintsEnforcer() method)
  - add more built-in functionality, e.g. snap-to-grid 
  - can we (de)serialize these?

* Math
  - Transform: more operations e.g. rotate about point etc.
  - Add classes for working with lines, line segments, intersections
  - Bounding box (a.k.a. extents) support, hit detection
  - Clipping during draws
  - PolyLines/Polygons with arc/curve segments

* Animation
  - More building blocks
  - Support for pausing/unpausing

* (De)Serialization to other formats
  - XML
  - SVG

* More support for dragging
  - Rotate around control point
  - Stretching / Scaling
  - Shearing
  - Other building blocks for shape editors
  
* Support for zoom, pinch etc.
  - E.g. invoke one method and it installs the appropriate listeners (for Mouse vs. Touch)
    for basic zooming/pinching etc.
  - Zoom full screen to bounding box of all shapes (needs bounding box support)
